# Domoticz-Gatekeeper-Plugin
Domoticz Python plugin for eGardia, Woonveilig GATE01, GATE-02 and GATE03

After checking some modules to communicate with eGardia/Woonveilig I did find a semi standalone module for OpenHAB created by jeroenterheerdt/python-egardia here on Github. 

This module seemed to most promising to embedd into a Domoticz plugin. However despite my 25 years of programming I never deveopled in Python. 

After trying to embed the class into a Domoticz Plugin for over a week I found out that the Domoticz Plugin system is not that flexible and a simple import of the python-egarida class into a plugin was not that easy. Thatâ€™s why I decided to reuse the code of the python-egarida class in combination with   domoticz-woonveilig plugin created by StuffNL to create a complete new plugin that can talk to the GATE-01, GATE-02 and GATE-03 of eGardia / Woonveilig. 

The functions of the plugin:

-	Read the Gates devicelist and create the PIR and Switch devices
-	Create a extra device that contains the actual state of the Gate.

Todo:
-	Making the plugin more fail save
-	Let the plugin set the state of the Gate


Please note that the plugin is absolute without ANY warranty, and that this plugin is my first programming in Python.
